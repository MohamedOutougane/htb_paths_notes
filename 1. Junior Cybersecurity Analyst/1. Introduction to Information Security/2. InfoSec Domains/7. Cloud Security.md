# Cloud Security

As more people use these shared storage facilities (cloud services), making sure everyone's property (data) is secure becomes more challenging. The risks are different from keeping things at home because you're sharing space and relying on the facility's management for certain parts of security. In the storage facility, both you and the facility owners have roles in keeping your items safe. The facility provides overall security, like guards and surveillance cameras, but you the individual are responsible for locking your individual storage unit. This is called the **shared responsibility model** in cloud security. The cloud provider secures the building (the infrastructure), while you secure your own unit (your data and applications).

In this shared storage facility, several things could potentially jeopardize the safety of your belongings. For example, someone might pick the lock to your unit and steal your items, which is similar to a **data breach** in cloud security where unauthorized individuals access your sensitive information. The facility's access system might have flaws that allow unauthorized people to enter, similar to **insecure APIs** in cloud services that can be exploited by hackers. You might accidentally forget to lock your storage unit properly, leaving it open to anyone. This mirrors m**isconfigured cloud storage**, where improper settings expose data to the public unintentionally. Additionally, someone could steal your access card or code and pretend to be you, leading to **account hijacking** where attackers gain control over your account and access your data without permission.

### Key Areas of Cloud Security
To protect against these threats, cloud security focuses on several key areas.

**Data protection** involves measures like using a strong lock and perhaps even a safe inside your unit, ensuring only you can access your valuables. This translates to encrypting your data both when it's stored (at rest) and when it's being moved (in transit), so it's secure at all times.

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is another crucial aspect, ensuring that only authorized individuals can enter your storage unit. It's like having a personalized key or access code that only you know, preventing others from accessing your space.

**Network security** in the cloud is comparable to having secure hallways and monitored entrances in the facility, preventing unauthorized people from wandering around. This includes firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs) that protect data as it moves through the network.

Lastly, **compliance** and **governance** involve adhering to rules that everyone must follow, like not storing illegal items in the facility. In business terms, this means following laws and regulations about how data is handled and secured, ensuring that all practices meet industry standards and legal requirements.
