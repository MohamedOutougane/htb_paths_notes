https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/293/section/3316

Several key elements work together to form a comprehensive protection strategy in network security. These are but not limited to:

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Firewalls** |	Act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, filtering traffic based on predetermined security rules. |
| **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**	 | Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and take automated actions to detect or block potential threats. |
| **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** |	Provide secure, encrypted connections over public networks, ensuring data privacy and integrity during transmission. For example, used by employees to connect to internal network resources. |
| **Access control mechanisms** | Include authentication and authorization protocols to ensure only legitimate users can access network resources. |
| **Encryption technologies** | Protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest, rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties. |
