# Application Security
https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/293/section/3317

This is a pseudo co to  illustrate how a program might function

```python
    # 1. Start Building the House (Develop the App)
    def build_house():
        # Put locks on doors and windows (Secure Authentication)
        install_locks_on_doors_and_windows()

        # Use strong walls and materials (Write Secure Code)
        use_strong_materials_for_walls()

        # Ensure the roof doesn't leak (Encrypt Data)
        install_waterproof_roof()


    # 2. Inspect the House for Weak Spots (Test for Vulnerabilities)
    def inspect_house():
        # Check if doors are locked properly (Penetration Testing)
        test_if_locks_are_working()

        # Make sure there are no cracks in the walls (Check for Bugs)
        look_for_cracks_in_walls()

        # Test if the roof holds up against rain (Test Data Security)
        test_roof_with_water()


    # 3. Keep the House Safe Over Time (Ongoing Security Monitoring)
    def maintain_house_security():
        # Watch out for unusual activity (Monitor for Threats)
        install_security_cameras()

        # Fix any new cracks or broken locks (Patch Vulnerabilities)
        repair_cracks_and_replace_broken_locks()


    # The overall process of Application Security
    def protect_application():
        build_house()              # Develop the app securely
        inspect_house()            # Test for vulnerabilities
        maintain_house_security()  # Monitor and maintain security over time


    # Call the function to secure the application (House)
    protect_application()
```

Let's break it down:

#### 1. Start Building the House (Develop the App)
- **Locks on doors and windows**: When you create an app, you need to make sure only the right people can get in (authentication), like how a house needs good locks to keep strangers out.

- **Strong walls and materials**: The app's code should be solid and free from weaknesses that hackers could exploit, just like you would build a house with strong materials to prevent it from collapsing.

- **Waterproof roof**: Encrypting data means protecting sensitive information, like making sure your house’s roof doesn’t leak during rain. This ensures no one can read or steal your data while it's being transferred.

#### 2. Inspect the House for Weak Spots (Test for Vulnerabilities)
- **Test if locks are working**: This is like testing an app to see if hackers can break in by trying different methods (penetration testing).

- **Look for cracks in walls**: Just as you’d inspect a house for any cracks, developers need to check their app’s code for bugs or weak spots that could be used by attackers.

- **Test roof with water**: After you’ve built the app, you need to make sure sensitive data stays protected, just like testing a roof to ensure it doesn't leak during a storm.

#### 3. Keep the House Safe Over Time (Ongoing Security Monitoring)
- **Install security cameras**: Even after building and testing your app, you must monitor it regularly to catch any new threats or problems, just like using security cameras to watch for intruders.

- **Fix cracks and replace broken locks**: Apps need regular updates to fix vulnerabilities or bugs, just like how you would repair cracks or replace broken locks to keep a house safe.

One good approch is called **Security by Design**, you dont implemented security feature later, you build it into the app from the start.

In software development, Security by Design works the same way. When creating an app, developers think about security right from the planning stage. This can include:

- **Threat modeling**: Like imagining all the ways someone might break into your house, threat modeling helps developers figure out potential risks to the app early on.

- **Secure code reviews**: After writing the code, developers carefully check it to make sure there are no weak spots, similar to inspecting the house’s foundation for cracks before finishing construction.

- **Servers and databases**: These are like the land your house sits on and the water supply it uses. If they aren’t secure, the whole system is at risk.

- **Authentication and authorization**: Think of these as high-quality locks on your doors. Authentication ensures only the right people can get in, while authorization makes sure they can only access the rooms (data) they’re allowed to.
